Allulose is unique in that it is not metabolized by the body in the same way as traditional sugars, contributing negligible calories and having little to no impact on blood glucose levels. Known for its clean, sugar-like taste without the associated caloric load, allulose is increasingly used in the food industry as a sugar substitute in various products, including beverages, baked goods, and confectionery. Its properties make it suitable for individuals managing their calorie intake or those with diabetes, and its versatility as a sweetener continues to make it a popular choice in formulating reduced-sugar and low-calorie food options."
