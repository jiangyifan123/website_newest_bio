It is approximately 200 times sweeter than sucrose, making it an efficient sweetening agent, and is commonly utilized in sugar-free or reduced-calorie products such as diet sodas, sugar-free gum, and light desserts. While aspartame has faced occasional scrutiny and controversy, extensive scientific research supports its safety for consumption by the general population, except for individuals with phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare genetic disorder. Aspartame's ability to deliver sweetness without contributing to caloric intake has positioned it as a popular choice for those seeking alternatives to sugar in their dietary preferences."
