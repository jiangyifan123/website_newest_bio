While the body can synthesize glutamine, during times of stress, illness, or intense physical activity, the demand may exceed the body's production. L-glutamine is found in various protein-rich foods and is often included as a supplement to support muscle recovery, reduce muscle soreness, and enhance overall exercise performance. Its ability to serve as a fuel source for rapidly dividing cells, such as those in the immune system and the cells lining the digestive tract, makes L-glutamine a valuable nutrient. As a food-grade supplement, L-glutamine undergoes quality control measures to ensure safety and efficacy. It is commonly utilized in protein powders, sports nutrition products, and certain functional foods, catering to individuals seeking to optimize their muscle health and overall well-being."

Its indispensability arises from the fact that animals cannot synthesize it internally, necessitating its inclusion in their diets. Beyond its role in protein formation, L-Methionine serves as a primary source of sulfur, contributing to the synthesis of other essential sulfur-containing amino acids. The supplementation of animal feeds with L-Methionine is known to enhance growth rates, improve feed efficiency, and bolster the animals' immune systems. This amino acid is particularly crucial in diets where natural feed ingredients may lack sufficient methionine levels, ensuring balanced nutrition and fostering the health and productivity of various animal species."

Additionally, HMOs have been associated with various health benefits, including immune system support and protection against pathogens. The composition of HMOs in breast milk is dynamic, adapting to the specific needs of the infant at different stages of development.

                    "Allulose, a low-calorie sweetener, has garnered attention for its ability to mimic the taste and texture of sugar while providing minimal calories. Classified as a rare sugar, it occurs naturally in small quantities in certain fruits and foods. Allulose is unique in that it is not metabolized by the body in the same way as traditional sugars, contributing negligible calories and having little to no impact on blood glucose levels. Known for its clean, sugar-like taste without the associated caloric load, allulose is increasingly used in the food industry as a sugar substitute in various products, including beverages, baked goods, and confectionery. Its properties make it suitable for individuals managing their calorie intake or those with diabetes, and its versatility as a sweetener continues to make it a popular choice in formulating reduced-sugar and low-calorie food options."
